## Tech
OfficeTweaks uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
- [pdf2image] - A python module that wraps the pdftoppm utility to convert PDF to PIL Image object
- [docx2pdf] - Convert docx to pdf on Windows or macOS directly using Microsoft Word
- [pdf2docx] - Open source Python library converting pdf to docx
- [img2pdf] - Lossless conversion of raster images to PDF
- [pillow] - Pillow is a fork of PIL, the Python Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors

And of course OfficeTweaks itself is open source with a [public repository][OfficeTweaks] on GitHub.
